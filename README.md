# Array Project

## Purpose of project

The intent of this project was to produce three algorithms.

They are:

1. A bubble sort (from lowest to highest)

2. An algorithm to merge (from lowest to highest) two ordered arrays

3. A merge sort method, breaking an array down into it's smallest components and rebuilding it in order (from lowest to highest). Specifically using recursion.


## Items to complete

**Testing for Merge Sort**
To be completed alongside and built upon after completion of initial program

*Deadline = TBD*

**Testing for Bubble Sort**
To be completed to test the algorithm and be used to improve it

*Deadline = None necessary to be completed asap*

## Completed Items

**Merging two ordered arrays (from lowest to highest)** - Completed *11/03/2022*

**Bubble Sort** - Completed *08/03/2022*

**Merge Sort** - Completed *14/03/2022*
